# GPA Calculator

This is a very basic GPA (Grade Point Average) calculator, designed to help students, especially those from VTU (Visvesvaraya Technological University) and other engineering colleges, easily compute their SGPA (Semester Grade Per Annum) and CGPA (Cumulative Grade Per Annum) based on acquired grades and credits. 

In many colleges, the SGPA / CGPA is not directly provided, and students are required to calculate it manually using their grades and credits. This tool simplifies that process.

## Features

- Edit course names and credits.
- Input grades for each course.
- Calculate SGPA with a simple click.
- Calculate CGPA with total credits and acquired SGPA for each semester
- Changes are saved locally, so you wonâ€™t lose your data after reloading the page.

## Technologies Used
