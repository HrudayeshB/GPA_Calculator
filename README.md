# SGPA Calculator

This is an SGPA (Semester Grade Point Average) calculator, designed to help students, especially those from VTU (Visvesvaraya Technological University) and other engineering colleges, easily compute their SGPA based on acquired grades and credits. 

In many colleges, the SGPA is not directly provided, and students are required to calculate it manually using their grades and credits. This tool simplifies that process.

## Features
- Add and remove courses.
- Edit course names and credits.
- Input grades for each course.
- Calculate SGPA with a simple click.
- Changes are saved locally, so you wonâ€™t lose your data after reloading the page.

## Technologies Used
- HTML, CSS, JavaScript for frontend design and functionality.
- LocalStorage to store course and grade data between sessions.
- Fully responsive design, optimized for both desktop and mobile browsers.

## How to Use
1. Open the webpage.
2. Enter your course names and credits, or edit existing ones.
3. Input your grades for each course.
4. Click **Calculate SGPA** to get your result.
5. Use the **Edit** button to make changes to courses and credits.

## Installation
You can easily host the project locally:
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/sgpa-calculator.git
2. Open the index.html file in your browser to start using the calculator.
